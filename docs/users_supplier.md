At the top is the top bar, which shows the name of the agency and the authenticated user, along with the date and time. Below this is a frame with the name of the module and a refresh button that refreshes the data on the cards. Additionally, there is a dropdown menu that allows you to filter open, closed, or archived processes, making it easy to find specific information. There is also a tab that refers to the "Operational" part, which allows the user to quickly and efficiently access the relevant information. Finally, there are two Cards **("Approvals" and "Ordres")** that serve as links to their respective modules on the Dashboard. Overall, the interface is intuitive and easy to use, allowing the user agency Manager to quickly and efficiently access the information they need.
